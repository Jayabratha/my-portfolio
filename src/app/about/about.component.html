    <p>     
    I am a frontend developer with full stack experience by profession and I am an artist and designer by passion. As a
    developer I mostly work on web and Javascript currently focusing on MEAN(MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS) technology 
    stack. I love creating my own designs and open source components and always keep me involved in proof of concepts and 
    projects on latest technologies.<br/><br/>
    
    Designing has always been with me even before I started loving technology. I use to design products as well along with
    portraits and paintings. Being a frontend developer, nowadays I am mostly into interface design that are delightful and 
    accessible.
